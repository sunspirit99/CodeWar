1. BreakingChocolateProblem.go : 

Your task is to split the chocolate bar of given dimension n x m into small squares. Each square is of size 1x1 and unbreakable. Implement a function that will return minimum number of breaks needed.

For example if you are given a chocolate bar of size 2 x 1 you can split it to single squares in just one break, but for size 3 x 1 you must do two breaks.

If input data is invalid you should return 0 (as in no breaks are needed if we do not have any chocolate to split). Input will always be a non-negative integer.

2. BuildPileOfCubes.go :

Your task is to construct a building which will be a pile of n cubes. The cube at the bottom will have a volume of n^3, the cube above will have volume of (n-1)^3 and so on until the top which will have a volume of 1^3.

You are given the total volume m of the building. Being given m can you find the number n of cubes you will have to build?

The parameter of the function findNb (find_nb, find-nb, findNb, ...) will be an integer m and you have to return the integer n such as n^3 + (n-1)^3 + ... + 1^3 = m if such a n exists or -1 if there is no such n.

Examples:
findNb(1071225) --> 45

findNb(91716553919377) --> -1

3. CountTheDigit.go :

Take an integer n (n >= 0) and a digit d (0 <= d <= 9) as an integer.

Square all numbers k (0 <= k <= n) between 0 and n.

Count the numbers of digits d used in the writing of all the k**2.

Call nb_dig (or nbDig or ...) the function taking n and d as parameters and returning this count.


4. RectangleIntoSquares.go :

The drawing below gives an idea of how to cut a given "true" rectangle into squares ("true" rectangle meaning that the two dimensions are different).

Can you translate this drawing into an algorithm?

You will be given two dimensions

a positive integer length
a positive integer width
You will return a collection or a string (depending on the language; Shell bash, PowerShell, Pascal and Fortran return a string) with the size of each of the squares.

sqInRect(5, 3) should return [3, 2, 1, 1]
sqInRect(3, 5) should return [3, 2, 1, 1]

5. ComplimentaryDNA.go :

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.

If you want to know more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA

In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". You have function with one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to get the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).

More similar exercise are found here: http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/ (source)

DNA_strand ("ATTGC") # return "TAACG"
DNA_strand ("GTAT") # return "CATA"

6. MaximumLengthDifference.go :

You are given two arrays a1 and a2 of strings. Each string is composed with letters from a to z. Let x be any string in the first array and y be any string in the second array.

Find max(abs(length(x) âˆ’ length(y)))

If a1 and/or a2 are empty return -1 in each language except in Haskell (F#) where you will return Nothing (None).

7. ArithmeticFunction.go :

Given two numbers and an arithmetic operator (the name of it, as a string), return the result of the two numbers having that operator used on them.

a and b will both be positive integers, and a will always be the first number in the operation, and b always the second.

The four operators are "add", "subtract", "divide", "multiply".

8. Anagram.go :

What is an anagram? Well, two words are anagrams of each other if they both contain the same letters. For example:
'abba' & 'baab' == true

'abba' & 'bbaa' == true

'abba' & 'abbba' == false

'abba' & 'abca' == false

9. DuplicateEncode.go : 

The goal of this exercise is to convert a string to a new string where each character in the new string is "(" if that character appears only once in the original string, or ")" if that character appears more than once in the original string. Ignore capitalization when determining if a character is a duplicate.

10. ParityOutlier.go : 

You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.

11. VasyaAndClerk.go :

The new "Avengers" movie has just been released! There are a lot of people at the cinema box office standing in a huge line. Each of them has a single 100, 50 or 25 dollar bill. An "Avengers" ticket costs 25 dollars.

Vasya is currently working as a clerk. He wants to sell a ticket to every single person in this line.

Can Vasya sell a ticket to every person and give change if he initially has no money and sells the tickets strictly in the order people queue?

Return YES, if Vasya can sell a ticket to every person and give change with the bills he has at hand at that moment. Otherwise return NO.

12. WeightForWeight.go :

My friend John and I are members of the "Fat to Fit Club (FFC)". John is worried because each month a list with the weights of members is published and each month he is the last on the list which means he is the heaviest.

I am the one who establishes the list so I told him: "Don't worry any more, I will modify the order of the list". It was decided to attribute a "weight" to numbers. The weight of a number will be from now on the sum of its digits.

For example 99 will have "weight" 18, 100 will have "weight" 1 so in the list 100 will come before 99.

Given a string with the weights of FFC members in normal order can you give this string ordered by "weights" of these numbers?

13. UniqueNumber.go :

There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!
findUniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) === 2
findUniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) === 0.55

14. CamelCase.go : 

Write simple .camelCase method (camel_case function in PHP, CamelCase in C# or camelCase in Java) for strings. All words must have their first letter capitalized without spaces.

15. SmallestPossibleSum.go :

Given an array X of positive integers, its elements are to be transformed by running the following operation on them as many times as required:

if X[i] > X[j] then X[i] = X[i] - X[j]

When no more transformations are possible, return its sum ("smallest possible sum").

16. ClockwiseSpiral.go :

Classic definition: A spiral is a curve which emanates from a central point, getting progressively farther away as it revolves around the point.

Your objective is to complete a function createSpiral(N) that receives an integer N and returns an NxN two-dimensional array with numbers 1 through NxN represented as a clockwise spiral.

Return an empty array if N < 1 or N is not int / number

17. ProductOfConsecutiveFibNumbers.go : 

The Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence (Fn):

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, ...

such as

F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) with F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1.

Given a number, say prod (for product), we search two Fibonacci numbers F(n) and F(n+1) verifying

F(n) * F(n+1) = prod.

Your function productFib takes an integer (prod) and returns an array:
[F(n), F(n+1), true] or {F(n), F(n+1), 1} or (F(n), F(n+1), True)
depending on the language if F(n) * F(n+1) = prod.

If you don't find two consecutive F(n) verifying F(n) * F(n+1) = prodyou will return

[F(n), F(n+1), false] or {F(n), F(n+1), 0} or (F(n), F(n+1), False)
F(n) being the smallest one such as F(n) * F(n+1) > prod.
